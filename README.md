# README
Using Crafting Interpreters as a guide, this will hopefully be an attempt at implimenting the jlox language from the book. The contets of the book are not mine and any sample code from the book is also not mine. The Language name "jlox" belongs to Robert Nystrom. Do not claim it as your own. This is mearly an implementation of his language. My implementation is under an MIT License.
